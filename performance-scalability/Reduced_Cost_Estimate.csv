Updates:
Conversion of t3.2xlarge instances from "On demand" to "Convertible reserved instances". With this update it is possible to save a part through the commitment to keep the resource in use for 1 year.

Downgrading EC2 instances from m4.10xlarge to m4.4xlarge and changing the type from "On demand" to "Convertible reserved instances". In this way, we can opt for a slightly less powerful processing, but with a lower price and good performance. As it is of the "Convertible reserved instances" type, it can be changed over time to accompany the growth of the product.
