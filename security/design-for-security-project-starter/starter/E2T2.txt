Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Vulnerabilities:

1 - Instances with public IP address. 
Recommendations: Use a non-default VPC, deploy instances in private subnets.

2 - Resources connection ports reachable from the internet.
Recommendations: Deploy the resources in no-default security groups or change security groups of existing resources, apply NAT Gateway configurations and NACLs or WAFs.

3 - IAM inline policies that allow decryption actions.
Recommendations: Apply Roles and Policies using the best practice of least privilegies.

4 - IAM customer managed policies that allow wildcard actions for services.
Recommendations: Apply Roles and Policies using the best practice of least privilegies.

5 - EC2 instances without Instance Metadata Service Version (IMDSv2).
Recommendations: Request instance metadata and modify the Amazon EC2 metadata options to IMDSv2 or configure the metadata for new instances.

6 - Port ranges reachable from an Unternet Gateway.
Recommendations: Restrict access to resouces by modifying security groups or ACLs in the network path.

7 - CloudFormation stacks not connected with Simple Notification Service (SNS).
Recommendations: Update CloudFormation stacks adding SNS integration in stacks.

8 - Use root user.
Recommendations: Don't use root user, because this profile have unrestricted access to all services and resources. Follow the best practice of least privilege and apply IAM policies to groups and roles instead.

9 - Logs and metrics filter and alarms doesn't exist.
Recommendations: Create and configure metrics and alarms for resources using CloudTrail, CloudWatch, SNS and AWS Config to monitor actions and changes made to resources, authentication failures and schedule deletions of resources.
